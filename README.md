# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project


INTRODUCTION:

  Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

  EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate. 
  
  In this analysis, I performed some data exploration processes that helps to understand the data and that can be used to drive key-insights from it. 

DATASET: Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india

TOOLS USED:

  * Google Colab
  * Python
  * Tableau Public

PYTHON LIBRARIES:

  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Seaborn

STEPS INVOLVED IN EDA:

1.  Importing the required libraries -Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn
2.  Importing the dataset using the pandas library and creating a dataframe.
3.  Exploring the dataset to understand the data by viewing the dataset structure, shape, datatypes and formats of the data.
4.  Checking the dataset for the null values, outliers and missing values.
5.  Processing the dataset with py libraries and creating the visuals to draw insights from it.

DATA VISUALIZATION:

  Tableau Public is used for Data Visualization - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/suresh3407/viz/EmploymentrateinIndia/Dashboard1

CONCLUSION:

  Exploring the unemployment dataset, it defines that unemployment rate varies state to state when compared to employed rate.
